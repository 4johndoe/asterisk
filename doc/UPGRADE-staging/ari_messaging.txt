The "TextMessageReceived" event used to include a list of "TextMessageVariable"
objects as part of its output. Due to a couple of bugs in Asterisk a list of
received variables was never included even if ones were available. However,
variables set to send would be (which they should have not been), but would
fail validation due to the bad formatting.

So basically there was no way to get a "TextMessageReceived" event with
variables. Due to this the API has changed. The "TextMessageVariable" object
no longer exists. "TextMessageReceived" now returns a JSON object of key/value
pairs. So for instance instead of a list of "TextMessageVariable" objects:

[ TextMessageVariable, TextMessageVariable, TextMessageVariable]

where a TextMessageVariable was supposed to be:

{ "key": "<var name>", "value":, "<var value>" }

The output is now just:

{ "<var name>": "<var value>" }

This aligns more with how variables are specified when sending a message, as
well as other variable lists in ARI.
