Asterisk headers are no longer installed and uninstalled automatically when
performing a "make install" or a "make uninstall".  To install/uninstall the
headers, use "make install-headers" and "make uninstall-headers".  The headers
also continue to be uninstalled when performing a "make uninstall-all".
