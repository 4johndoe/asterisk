Subject: res_pjsip

Added a new PJSIP global setting called norefersub.
Default is true to keep support working as before.

res_pjsip_refer configures PJSIP norefersub capability accordingly.

Checks the PJSIP global setting value.
If it is true (default) it adds the norefersub capability to PJSIP.
If it is false (disabled) it does not add the norefersub capability
to PJSIP.

This is useful for Cisco switches that do not follow RFC4488.
