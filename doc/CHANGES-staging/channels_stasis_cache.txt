Subject: Channels

The core no longer uses the stasis cache for channels snapshots.
The following APIs are no longer available:
    ast_channel_topic_cached()
    ast_channel_topic_all_cached()
The ast_channel_cache_all() and ast_channel_cache_by_name() functions
now returns an ao2_container of ast_channel_snapshots rather than a
container of stasis_messages therefore you can't call stasis_cache
functions on it.
The ast_channel_topic_all() function now returns a normal topic,
not a cached one so you can't use stasis cache functions on it either.
The ast_channel_snapshot_type() stasis message now has the
ast_channel_snapshot_update structure as it's data.
ast_channel_snapshot_get_latest() still returns the latest snapshot.
