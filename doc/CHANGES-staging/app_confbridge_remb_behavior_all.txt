Subject: ConfBridge

Add "average_all", "highest_all", and "lowest_all" values for
the remb_behavior option. These values operate on a bridge
level instead of a per-source level. This means that a single
REMB value is calculated and sent to every sender, instead of
a REMB value that is unique for the specific sender..
