Master-Only: True

A new option, incoming_call_offer_pref, was added to res_pjsip endpoints that
specifies the preferred order of codecs to use between those received in the
offer, and those set in the configuration.

Valid values include:
  local - prefer and order by configuration (default).
  local_single - prefer and order by configuration, but only choose 'top'
                 most codec
  remote - prefer and order by incoming sdp.
  remote_single - prefer and order by incoming sdp, but only choose 'top' most
                  most codec

Example A:
  [alice]
  type=endpoint
  incoming_call_offer_pref=local
  allow=!all,opus,alaw,ulaw

  Alice's incoming sdp=g722,ulaw,alaw
  RESULT: alaw,ulaw

Example B:
  [alice]
  type=endpoint
  incoming_call_offer_pref=local_single
  allow=!all,opus,alaw,ulaw

  Alice's incoming sdp=g722,ulaw,alaw
  RESULT: alaw

Example C:
  [alice]
  type=endpoint
  incoming_call_offer_pref=remote
  allow=!all,opus,alaw,ulaw

  Alice's incoming sdp=g722,ulaw,alaw
  RESULT: ulaw,alaw

Example D:
  [alice]
  type=endpoint
  incoming_call_offer_pref=remote_single
  allow=!all,opus,alaw,ulaw

  Alice's incoming sdp=g722,ulaw,alaw
  RESULT: ulaw
